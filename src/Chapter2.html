<h2>Chapter 2 The wrath of khan </h2>


    <p>
        Khan implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous creatures that enter the ears of their victims and makes them  susceptible to mind control, and uses the officers to capture the Reliant.
        Learning of Genesis, Khan attacks the space station Regula 1 where the device is being developed by Kirk's ex-wife , Dr. Carol Marcus, and their son, David.

    <p>
        The Enterprise embarks on a three-week training voyage.
        Kirk assumes command after the ship receives a distress call from Regula 1.
        En route, the Enterprise is ambushed and crippled by the Reliant, leading to the deaths and injuries of many trainees.
        Khan hails the Enterprise and offers to spare Kirk's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis.

    <p>
        Kirk stalls for time and uses the Reliant's prefix code to remotely lower the ships shields, allowing the Enterprise to counter-attack.
        .Khan is forced to retreat and mske repairs, while the Enterprise helps  Regula I. Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive, along with slaughtered members of Marcus's team.
        They soon find Carol and David hiding deep inside the planetoid of Regula.
        Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk;
        Terrell resists the eel's influence and kills himself while Chekov faints as the eel leaves his body.
