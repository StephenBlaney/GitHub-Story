<h2>Chapter 2 The wrath of khan </h2>

<p>
    Khan then transports Genesis aboard the Reliant. Though Khan believes his foe stranded on Regula I,
    Kirk and Spock use a coded message to arrange a rendezvous. Kirk directs the Enterprise into the nearby Mutara Nebula;
    static discharges inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making the Enterprise and the Reliant evenly matched.
    Spock notes however that Khan's tactics are two-dimensional,
    indicating inexperience in space combat, which Kirk then exploits to critically disable the Reliant.
