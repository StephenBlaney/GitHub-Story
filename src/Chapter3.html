    <h2>Chapter 3 The wrath of khan </h2>

    <p>
    Khan then transports Genesis aboard the Reliant. Though Khan believes his foe stranded on Regula I,
    Kirk and Spock use a coded message to arrange a rendezvous. Kirk directs the Enterprise into the nearby Mutara Nebula;
    static discharges inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making the Enterprise and the Reliant evenly matched.
    Spock notes however that Khan's tactics are two-dimensional,
    indicating inexperience in space combat, which Kirk then exploits to critically disable the Reliant.
    </p>

    <p>

    Mortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, which will reorganize all matter in the nebula,
    including the Enterprise. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation of Genesis and attempts to move out of range,
    they will not be able to escape the nebula in time due to the ship's damaged warp drive.
    Spock goes to the engine room to restore the warp drive. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, as exposure to the high levels of radiation would be fatal, Spock incapacitates the doctor with a Vulcan nerve pinch and performs a mind meld, telling him to "remember". Spock successfully restores power to the warp drive and the Enterprise escapes the explosion, though at the cost of Spock's life.
    The explosion of Genesis causes the gas in the nebula to reform into a new planet, capable of sustaining life.

    </p>
    After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk arrives in the engine room and discovers Spock dying of radiation poisoning.
    The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve,
    McCoy manages to get spock to the ships infirmary to administrate an antidote to combat the poison
    Kurk watches as McCoy works thinking of the sacrifices that where made to stop khan plan
    Spocks recovers shortly after a few days and returns as 2nd officer to the star ship enterprise
