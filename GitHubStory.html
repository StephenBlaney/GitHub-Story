			<h2>Chapter 1 The wrath of khaan</h2>
			
			<p>
			
			In the year 2285, Admiral James T.
			Kirk oversees a simulator session of Captain Spock's trainees. In the simulation,
			Lieutenant Saavik commands the starship USS Enterprise on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship Kobayashi Maru.
			When the Enterprise enters the Klingon Neutral Zone to reach the ship it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged.
			The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers.
