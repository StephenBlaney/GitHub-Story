			<h2>Chapter 1 The wrath of khaan</h2>
			
			<p>
			
			In the year 2285, Admiral James T.
			Kirk oversees a simulator session of Captain Spock's trainees. In the simulation,
			Lieutenant Saavik commands the starship USS Enterprise on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship Kobayashi Maru.
			When the Enterprise enters the Klingon Neutral Zone to reach the ship it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged.
			The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers.

			Meanwhile, the USS Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet for testing of the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize matter to create habitable worlds for colonization.
			Reliant officers Commander Pavel Chekov and Captain Clark Terrell beam down to the surface of a possible candidate planet, which they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI; once there, they are captured by genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh.
